Programming language:
Scripting language: Scripting is a subset of programming languages. 
These are the languages that are interpreted by another program at runtime.
 Scripting languages are often used to build web applications and are also used in many games. 
 Examples: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Lua, etc.


 statically typed language:

    we have to provide the type of data when we declare a variable.
    eg:c,c++,java
    int a = 10;

 daynamic typed language:
    
    we don't need to specify the type of data when we declare a variable.
    eg; javascript,python
    no1 = 10;
    x = "ram"

variable: variable are the containers which is used to store data...    

#how to get false input in input function...

operators:
operators are the symbols which is used to perform some operations on operands.
3 type of operators:
1)unary operator: which is used to perform operation on single operand.
         a++ ++a
         python doesn't support ++ and -- operator.
2)binary operator: which is used to perform operation on two operands.
3)ternary operator: which is used to perform operation on three operands.

1)arithmetic operator:
    +,-,*,/,%,//-> floor division ,** -> exponentiation
2)assignment operator:
    =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,//=,**=
3)relational operator:
    <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
4)logical operator:
    and,or,not
5) bitwise operator:
    &,|,^,~,<<,>>

6)membership operator:
      in,not in
7)identity operator:
      is,is not      



decision making statements:
condition :- True --> False -->
if else
loops
match case

if(condition){
    //statements
}
else{
    //statements
}


if condition:
    //statements
    //statements
    //statements
    //statements
else:
    //statements
    //statements
    //statements
    //statements
